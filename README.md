# This is an overview of my carsome project.
The goal of this project is to scrape data from 'www.carsome.com' and store it in a local Mysql database 
before performing ETL processes such as deleting null values, data imputation to change some columns that contain Thai language into English, 
adding dimension columns, and mapping the brand of the car with the origin countries for analytic usecases.

Furthermore, requests some  API customer data in order to run a scenario in which a person is offered a deal for buying a 2nd-handed used car.
